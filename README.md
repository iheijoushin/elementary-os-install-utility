## What it does:
This utility helps you install Elementary OS on a Mac. It installs rEFInd (an EFI boot picker) to the EFI System Partition, and burns a thumb drive with the Elementary OS installer.

You'll need an Elementary OS ISO from the Elementary OS [website](http://elementaryos.org) to install, and you'll need to make a FAT partition using Disk Utility. This will be documented in the greyed out button at the bottom of the app but instructions have not yet been written.
