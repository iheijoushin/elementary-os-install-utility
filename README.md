elementary-os-install-utility
=============================

Easy-to-use utility that installs Elementary OS on your Mac and helps you boot it

## Instructions
1. [Download](https://github.com/sdaitzman/elementary-os-install-utility/releases/download/3.2.0beta/Elementary-OS-Install-utility.app.zip)
2. Open
3. Follow the instructions

## What it does
This utility helps you install Elementary OS on a Mac. It installs rEFInd (an EFI boot picker) to the EFI System Partition, and burns a thumb drive with the Elementary OS installer.

You'll need an Elementary OS ISO from the Elementary OS [website](http://elementaryos.org) to install, and you'll need to make a FAT partition using Disk Utility. This will be documented in the greyed out button at the bottom of the app but instructions have not yet been written.
