# Instructions:

## I make a number of assumptions about your Mac

1.  I assume it’s fairly recent, with a core-i3/i5/i7 processor (64-bit EFI only) - hackintosh not officially supported

2.  I assume you do not have Filevault or Bootcamp turned on. If you do, this app will work but you’ll probably be unable to boot without repairs.

3.  I assume your Mac’s low-level partition setup is relatively standard. If you haven’t gone far out of your way to change it, it is. I assume your ESP is at /dev/disk0s1, and you have at least one Mac partition.

## Installation:

1.  [Download](http://cl.ly/3Y022Q1b3E2m/download/Elementary%20OS%20Install%20utility.app.zip) the app and open it

2.  Click “Full install” and click OK to get started, then enter an admin name and password

3.  Choose how much space to give Elementary OS in GB (Gigabytes) - slightly more than this much will be lost from your Mac and given to Elementary OS
4.  Wait; this could take a while, do not stop or restart until the operation is complete.
5.  Choose an ISO file downloaded from the [Elementary OS website](http://elementaryos.org) - the version must be at least Freya (0.3) which, as of this writing, is in beta
6.  Click "OK" and restart your computer - you'll see the boot picker on startup
7.  Press "ESC"
